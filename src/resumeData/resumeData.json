    "bio": "Since childhood, I have enjoyed exploring new endeavors that pose new challenges. I use my love for problem solving to discover oppurtunities to implement programmatic solutions. Currently, I am looking for oppurtunities to expand my professional skill set through software engineering or fintech roles. Besides my professional interest, I also enjoy sports and outdoor activities. Some of my favorites are hiking, skiing and playing volleyball with friends. I love talking about news in tech, business and volleyball. Feel free to reach out through the contact button and start the conversation.",
